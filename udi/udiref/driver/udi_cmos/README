This is a UDI driver for the PC CMOS chipset.  The PC CMOS provides
storage for floppy and hard drive information, memory size, and other
persistent storage.  It also provides a real-time clock. 

udi_cmos is meant mostly to be an example of a simple UDI driver.  It
doesn't provide "production quality" features such as interlocking the
RTC during a rollover to guarantee atomicity.   A walk-through of this
driver can be found at

and 
 http://www.sco.com/forum1999/conference/developfast/f10/.

The code may have changed somewhat since those talks were prepared but
they are still quite pertinent to the driver.

Note: udi_cmos is "odd" in the current UDI framework becuase it isn't
really a PCI device.
