Whipit is a sample UDI driver that functions as an NSR.  It was provided
by Intel for developint NIC drivers independently of the host networking
stacks and any net mappers.  It's not at all a tool for the casual
user.  It is currently rather crude, but quite useful.  It's been used,
for example, to bring up physical I/O (DMA, PIO, Interrupts) on an
environment when no UDI network mapper was yet available.

Once it binds to a child on the net meta, it will loop eternally
creating tx packets and handing them to the driver and discarding rx
packets that it gets from the driver.  If you happen to have enough
clock cycles left over, you can get into a kernel debugger or other
memory groper (like KME from kme.sourceforge.net) and watch the
performance counters that it gathers in its region data..

It's tempting to add a GIO channel to whipit to control starting,
stopping, max packet counts, statistics display and such.  Doing so
introduces a dependency on a host GIO mapper, so perhaps this should
be optional.  Another "obvious" enhancement would be to drive the tx
from a timer and/or provide some form of governors so that it doesn't
monopolize the host while running.

Unload is known to be broken.  Since whipit will probably take over your
computer, you probably couldn't issue the unload command anyway. :-)
