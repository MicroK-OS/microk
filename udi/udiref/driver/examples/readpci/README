readpci is a UDI application to dump PCI config space of a device.  It
binds to no children and has only a single PCI parent.  It is offered
as an example of how to read PCI config space portably and how to use
udi_debug_print non-trivially.  Edit udiprops.txt to point it to the
device you're interested in.   When run in an environment that supports
udi_debug_printf, you will see output like this:

	Vendor 1002, Device 4742
	<CLASS=Display controller>
	<DEVSEL=fast,Fast back-to-back capable>
	<Prefetchable,Type=32 bit> at 0xe3000000 [0xe3000008].
	I/O at 0xd800 [0x0000d801].
	<Non-prefetchable,Type=32 bit> at 0xe2000000 [0xe2000000].

It never writes to the card so it can be used on devices that are bound
to other drivers.

This code was flagrantly lifted from udi_cmos.  Many internal references
to that driver remain.   This is not a good generic example UDI driver.
