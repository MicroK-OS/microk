udiref_hexdump() is a memory pretty-print routine using udi_debug_printf.
This functionality is provided through a udi "library", and is made
available to other UDI drivers once installed by udisetup.

You can use udiref_hexdump by placing this line in your udiprops.txt:
	requires udiref_hexdump 0x100
and placing this in your .c file that calls it:
	#include "udiref_hexdump.h"
udibuild will be able to find the header file from where the udisetup
on hexdump installed it.

Or at least, we *should* be able to create a UDI library module and
use it that way, but the current environment is slightly deficient.

In the interim, you can remove the header file name from the provides
line in udiprops.txt, copy/symlink udiref_hexdump.h manually, and
#include the header file.  [You may want to copy/link hexdump.c
and just add it to your source_files line as well, instead of using
a "requires" directive.]

Better yet, tweak the environment source code to do "the right thing"
with "provides" lines and send in a patch!

Enjoy!
