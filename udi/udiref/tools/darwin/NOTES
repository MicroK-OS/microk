Here are some instructions on how I brought udiref to Apple's Darwin.
(The BSD layer in MacOS 10 is called Darwin. It is an Apple
Public Source effort.  See www.publicsource.apple.com for more
info on Darwin. Darwin can be built for x86 & PowerPC.)

If you follow this, you'll notice that it is meant to be used as a
guide for bootstrapping udi on new OSs.

------------------------------------------

Building libelf. (libelf is not actually used, yet, but it's a 
good thing to have around for if/when ELF support is added for Darwin.)

wget http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/~michael/software/libelf-0.7.0.tar.gz 
tar -zxf libelf-0.7.0.tar.gz
cd libelf-0.7.0
setenv CFLAGS -traditional
./configure powerpc-apple-macos
make
make install


Building udiref...

cd udiref/
# If new platform: edit env/common/Make_conf for your platform.

# Make a tools directory
cp -R tools/exampleos tools/myos
# Take a look at existing OS's, you might use some other
# OS's tool support as your own.
# Edit the files in tools/myos as appropriate!
# Initially, some code can be ignored for posix-only environments, like
# Darwin, since they deal with the last step in the life of a driver:
# udisetup. At some point, you'll need to get it limping.

make
# fix any problems you run into!
