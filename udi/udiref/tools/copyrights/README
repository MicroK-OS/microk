Usage: fixup filename [ filename2 ... ] 


This program will look at your source file for lines of the form:

        /*
         * $Copyright core $
         */                    

and expand them to (and then self-expands to):
        /*                                  
         * $Copyright udi_reference:
         *                     
         * COPYRIGHT LINE 1...
         * COPYRIGHT LINE 2...
         *                    
         * $
         */

The leading character (comment character) is derived from the data
found before the "$Copyright" string.  This means it will work for C++
comments, C comments, or shell script comments.  All text up to the
trailing dollar sign is replaced.  The copyright text is derived from
the "msgs" directory and in this example will be read from a file named
"core".

If this file is run multiple times on the same input, the result should
be the same.

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING 

I would not trust this program on any source code that isn't retrievable
from CVS.   It's possible that it'll make dog meat out of your source.
It doesn't try to recover from errors.   

Since this program is expected to be run a low number of times over
the life cycle of the project, this isn't expected to be an issue.
